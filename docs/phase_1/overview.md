# Phase 1 Development Plan: Food Ordering Platform (Swiggy/Zomato Competitor)

## 🎯 Goal

Build a production-ready MVP that allows:

* Users to register, browse restaurants, add items to cart, and place orders
* Restaurants to manage their profile and menu
* Admins to approve restaurants and monitor activity
* Payments via Razorpay or Stripe

---

## 🔐 Authentication & User Management

* Implement user registration and login (email or phone)
* JWT token-based authentication with role support (user, partner, admin)
* Create endpoints for user profile retrieval and update
* Password hashing and validation

## 🧑‍🍳 Restaurant Management

* Restaurant partner registration/login
* Restaurant profile CRUD (name, description, location, opening hours)
* Upload and manage restaurant images
* Assign tags or cuisine types (e.g., Chinese, Indian, etc.)

## 📋 Menu & Catalog Management

* Add, update, delete menu categories (e.g., Starters, Main Course)
* CRUD for menu items: name, price, description, image, category
* Support for item availability (in stock/out of stock)
* Optional: Basic variant support (e.g., small/medium/large)

## 🛒 Cart & Order System

* Add item(s) to cart, update quantity, remove items
* View cart summary with pricing details
* Place order (create order record with status "PLACED")
* Order status flow: PLACED → CONFIRMED → COMPLETED
* Partner API to view and update order status

## 💳 Payment Integration

* Integrate Razorpay/Stripe SDK for initiating payments
* Implement webhook to verify payment success/failure
* Store payment transaction data with order reference
* Mark order as paid only on verified webhook call

## 🧑‍💻 Admin Module

* Admin login with elevated permissions
* Approve or reject registered restaurant partners
* View all users, restaurants, and order summaries
* Optionally export data (for reporting/debugging)

## 📍 Basic Location Awareness

* Users can save multiple delivery addresses
* Restaurants can be filtered by city or area name
* No real-time geo-distance logic at this phase

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

* API tests for each endpoint (unit + integration)
* Simulate full user flow: register → browse → cart → pay → order
* Simulate partner flow: register → add menu → receive orders
* Sandbox testing for payment gateway

## ⚙️ Technical Stack & Setup

* **Backend Framework**: FastAPI / Node.js / Django (as chosen by team)
* **Database**: PostgreSQL for relational data, Redis for cart & caching
* **Storage**: AWS S3 or local for image uploads
* **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions or manual Docker builds
* **Docs**: Swagger/OpenAPI for API documentation

## 📅 Suggested Timeline (4 Weeks)

* Week 1: Auth, User module, DB setup
* Week 2: Restaurant and Menu modules
* Week 3: Order and Payment modules
* Week 4: Admin APIs, Testing, Deployment

## 📝 Notes

* Stick to RESTful API design principles
* Use environment-based config for local/dev/prod
* Modular folder structure for clean separation
* Track bugs and enhancements in a shared task tracker

---

**Next Steps**:

* Confirm backend framework choice
* Initialize repository with base structure
* Define initial DB schema and migrations
* Share API design for review and alignment
