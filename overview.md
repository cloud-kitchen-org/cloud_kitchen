# Full Development Roadmap: Real-Time Food Ordering Platform

This document outlines the **complete development plan** across all phases for building and scaling a real-time food ordering platform similar to Swiggy/Zomato. It is designed to guide the team from MVP to a production-scale system.

---

## 🚀 Phase 1: Core MVP (3–4 Weeks)

### 🎯 Goal: Launch basic food ordering app in 1–2 locations

#### Features:

* Authentication (JWT)
* User roles (user, partner, admin)
* Restaurant registration and profile management
* Menu management (categories, items)
* Cart & order system
* Payment gateway integration (Razorpay/Stripe)
* Admin approval of restaurants
* Basic address management
* API documentation (Swagger/Postman)
* Dockerized deployment on cloud (AWS/GCP)

#### Deliverables:

* Complete backend APIs with testing
* Sample data seeded for users, restaurants, and menu
* Admin API interface (basic web or Postman)
* Deployed instance (dev/test environment)

---

## 📈 Phase 2: Scale & Optimization (4–6 Weeks)

### 🎯 Goal: Improve performance, add operational features, and analytics

#### Features:

* Partner dashboard UI for order tracking
* User order history and re-order functionality
* Analytics endpoints (popular items, daily orders)
* Search and filter (ElasticSearch for restaurants/items)
* Notifications system (email/SMS/in-app using Firebase/Twilio)
* Promo codes and discount logic
* Caching with Redis for restaurant/menu endpoints
* Queue system (Redis Queue / Celery) for background tasks
* Basic monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana or hosted tools)

#### Deliverables:

* Dashboard UI (React or React Native)
* Real-time updates via WebSocket/polling (basic)
* API rate limiting and error handling

---

## 🔒 Phase 3: Security, Compliance & Delivery (4–6 Weeks)

### 🎯 Goal: Add trust, delivery logic, and secure infrastructure

#### Features:

* Delivery partner module (registration, location tracking, order assignment)
* Real-time delivery tracking using GPS and WebSocket
* Advanced access control (RBAC/Scopes)
* GDPR/Indian IT compliance (data export, delete)
* API gateway & rate limiter
* Encrypted API keys, webhook secrets
* Secure file uploads (presigned S3 URLs)
* Audit logging and user/device logging

#### Deliverables:

* Full security checklist documentation
* Delivery partner mobile UI (React Native)
* Role-based access enforcement

---

## 🧠 Phase 4: Intelligence & Personalization (Optional, Post-Launch)

### 🎯 Goal: Boost user engagement with smart features

#### Features:

* Personalized home feed (based on order history, location)
* Collaborative filtering for recommendations
* Dynamic pricing logic for combos/offers
* Real-time metrics dashboard for admin (Grafana/Metabase)
* Natural language search ("show me best biryani near me")

#### Tools:

* ML models served via FastAPI or hosted model servers
* Vector DBs for semantic search (e.g., Pinecone/Faiss)

---

## 📌 Final Phase: Multi-City Expansion & Microservices (Scale Out)

### 🎯 Goal: Prepare for massive scale, modular architecture, and automation

#### Features:

* Split services into microservices or domain-based modules
* Container orchestration (Kubernetes/Docker Swarm)
* Auto-scaling infrastructure (ECS/EKS/GKE)
* Payment reconciliation system
* Admin reports + scheduled exports
* City-based restaurant discovery (with PostGIS)

#### Deliverables:

* Helm charts or Terraform scripts for infra
* Monitoring & alerting setup
* Fully CI/CD integrated deployment pipeline

---

## 🔁 Continuous Integration Checklist

* ✅ GitHub Actions for backend tests and linting
* ✅ Automated migrations (Alembic or Django)
* ✅ Deployment via Docker Compose / K8s
* ✅ Postman test collection on every push

## 📅 Sample Timeline (Total Duration: \~4–6 Months)

| Month   | Focus                                    |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Month 1 | MVP (Phase 1)                            |
| Month 2 | Phase 2 scaling + user dashboard         |
| Month 3 | Security, delivery partner app (Phase 3) |
| Month 4 | Personalization and intelligent modules  |
| Month 5 | Refactor into microservices              |
| Month 6 | Infrastructure automation and scale-up   |

---

This roadmap is intended to evolve with usage and feedback. Each phase should be tested, reviewed, and deployed iteratively with CI/CD and monitoring in place.
